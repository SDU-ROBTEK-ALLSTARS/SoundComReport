\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
Questions to be answered:

To what extend was it possible to make an API that implements a DTMF based
network?
How did the system perform during test? 
Are there things that should be testet further?

To what extend does the physical layer work? 
How did the physical layer perform during test?
What could make it even better?

  To what extend does the data link layer work? 
The data link layer is able to process a packet and enclose it in a sequence of
frames to be sent. It is also able to receive frames and to process them into at
packet to be delivered to the transport layer. The data link layer is also able
to control a token based network in a way that allows collision free half duplex
communication. 

  How did the data link layer perform during test? The data link
layer performed well under test and handles communication with up to sixty
percent errors, though this amount of errors makes it very slow. With more than
sixty percent errors all time goes into contol talk and almost no frames are
transmitted.

  What could make it even better?
If it is possible to find a way of using a sliding window instead of the eight
byte list currently implemented. There is currently a lot of transmission time
being wasted in sending lists shorter than eight entries. Other changes could be
considered to handle cases where a crucial frame is lost. For example the case
where a reply is lost which results in some waiting time and the entire list
being resend.

To what extend does the transport layer work? 
How did the transport layer perform during test?
What could make it even better?

To what extend does the API layer work? 
How did the API layer perform during test?
What could make it even better?

To what extend does the Backbone work? 
How did the backbone perform during test?
What could make it even better?
