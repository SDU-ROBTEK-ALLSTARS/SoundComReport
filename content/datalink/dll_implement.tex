\section{Implementation}
The data link layer is implemented as a \custtt{DataLinkLayer} class and a
\custtt{Frame} class as shown in \ref{fig:class_diag_for_datalink}. The
\custtt{DataLinkLayer} object is instantiated by the \custtt{BackBone} class and
controls the network token and the processing of frames into datagrams and vice
versa. When instantiated, the address and token are controlled by arguments. The
Frame objects and datagram objects are instantiated in buffers by the backbone
and presented to the data link layer as method arguments.

Two public methods are used to call the data link layer, one for upwards traffic
(\custtt{decode}) and one for downwards traffic (\custtt{encode}). Both methods are called with
pointers to the four accessible buffers as arguments. Furthermore the backbone
can call a method (\custtt{needs\-Attention}) to know whether the data link layer needs
extraordinary attention because a timer has run out. Another method
(\custtt{canTransmit}) tells the backbone whether the data link layer object holds the
network token and thereby is able to send encoded data.

The methods of the classes are developed to realize the
flowcharts\ref{fig:dll_flow_encode} and
\ref{fig:dll_flow_decode} of the data link layer. Decisions on whether to implement a method in one class or another is done using the expert pattern.

The token network is implemented to deal with the cases shown in
\ref{fig:dll_token_network}. It is important that the network is implemented to
support the half duplex nature of the DTMF tone based network, since any
collision would lead to errors. This is implemented by the EOT bit, that has to
be received before a non tokenholder can talk. The tokenholder waits a specified
amount of time after sendeing the EOT-bit before re-transmitting or moving on.
