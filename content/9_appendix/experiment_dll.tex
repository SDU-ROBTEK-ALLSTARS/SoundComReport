\section{Testing error handling in data link layer}\label{app:exp:dll_result}
The purpose of this experiment is to test the limits of error handling in the
data link layer.

\subsection{Procedure}
The test program \custtt{test\_2x\_dll.cpp} is developed to instantiate two data
link layer objects communicating through common buffers. The test utilises a
function \custtt{simulateError()} to introduce a defined percentage of errors
into the transmitted frames. The program iterates through error percentages from
one to eighty and records the time used to transfer one hundred bytes of data
for each iteration.

\subsection{Results}
A graph will be submitted here

\subsection{Conclusion}
Tests show that the time-error ratio is approximately linear up until around
forty percent. This is the environment in wich the protocol will work. When the
error percentage rises above fifty percent, so much effort goes into control
that almost no actual data are transmitted.
