\chapter{Boost C++ Library}\label{app:boost}
Boost provides a repository for free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. Boost provide a lot of quality components for developers to use and in the future some of them might become a part of the STL\footnote{Standard Template Library} library. The reason for choosing Boost is made because of the qaulity Boost can deliver, and this library is well documented. Furthermore Boost provide all the components needed for implementation of this project. Components used in development of this project are listed below:

\begin{description}
\item[Circular buffer]
is provided by Boost to give the developer the freedom to instantiate circular buffers of a given type. This type of buffer is also known as a ring buffer or cyclic buffer. It is essentially a data structure which forms a ring. 

\item[Thread]
is provided by Boost which enables a developer to manage multiple threads. A thread holds a process which is executed on a computer, allowing the use of multi threading enables a developer to execute multiple processes at the same time if the hardware and operating system is compatible with this behaviour, otherwise the multi threading is executed as multitasking, which is controlled by a time-division multiplexing process.

\item[CRC]
is provided by Boost to enable a developer with an easy-to-use CRC component. CRC is an abbreviation for cyclic redundancy code. The use of CRC in this project is based on the desire to check if data have been correctly sent and received.
