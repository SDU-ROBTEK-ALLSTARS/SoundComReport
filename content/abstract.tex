The base of this project is a given assignment to build a network using DTMF
tones. It is natural therefore to use the layers described in the OSI-model as
phases of both the project and the report.

\section*{Physical layer}
The probing of the physical layer forms a base for the entire project. It is
given that the physical layer is to transport data via DTMF tones. A thorough
examination of the physical layer is important since it defines the requirements
for the rest of the system. This phase will contain experiments and theoretical
proofs leading to a clear performance specification.

\section*{Data link and network layers}
The focus of this phase is error correction and flow control. Since the system
is exposed to noisy surroundings, it must be safe and reliable. The protocol
must be build to make multi-point networking possible.

\section*{Transport and session layers}
This layer opens and manages the connection and routes between different
processes on the station. It is also responsible for segmentation and reassembly
of packages.

\section*{Presentation and application layer}
This layer acts as the facade of the system, connecting the user application to
the network through an easy to use application programmer interface.
