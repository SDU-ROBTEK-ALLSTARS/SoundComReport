\chapter{Physical layer}
This chapter will contain an analysis of how it is possible to let DTMF tones
act as an information carrier. This analysis will be based on the basics of
networking and digital signal processing theory which means that the physical
aspects will not be taking into considerations and thus not be in the scope of
this document. The analysis will lead to several inferences which will create
the foundation for implementing the physical layer as software.

After the analysis the implementation will be explained in greater detail.
