\chapter{Physical Layer}
This chapter will be split into two parts and a soliloquy. The first part will
explain the main considerations that have been made during the design phase of
a physical layer which allow DTMF tones to act as information carriers.
The design is based on the basics of networking and digital signal processing
theory which means that the physical aspects will not be taking into considerations
and thus not be in the scope of this document. The design will lead to several
inferences which will create the foundation for implementing the physical layer as software.

The second part will explain the implementation in greater detail regarding the physical layer
interface, which functionality is exposed to the data link layer, and how does the BufferedSoundIO
work internally.

The soliloquy will contain a brief discussion of the thoughts made after the implementation
was done.
