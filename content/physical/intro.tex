\chapter{Physical Layer}\label{chap:physical}
This chapter will be split into three parts, first part will explain the main considerations that have been made during the design phase of a physical layer which uses DTMF tones to act as information carriers. The design is based on the basics of networking and digital signal processing theory which means that the physical aspects will not be taking into considerations and thus not be in the scope of this document. The design will create the foundation for implementing the physical layer as software.

The second part will explain the implementation in greater detail regarding the physical layers interface, which functionality is exposed to the data link layer, and the internal workings of the BufferedSoundIO class.

The third part will contain a brief discussion of the thoughts made after the implementation was done.
