\section{Callback functions}
Some of the functionality in the library depends on the concept of callback functions, and a short introduction to them is given here.
A callback function, is a piece of executable code, that can be executed at a later time. This is widely used in order to allow users of libraries to define custom functionality that the library can call without knowing what it is at compile time. For instance, the user of our library defines a callback function, that will be executed when a message is received.
