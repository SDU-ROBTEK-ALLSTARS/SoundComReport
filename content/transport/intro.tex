\chapter{Transport layer}\label{chap:transport}
In the OSI model, the session and transport layers handle process-to-process communication and sessions (chiefly used when a more permanent connection is required for synchronous transfer), respectively. When initially exploring ideas for this networking protocol stack,\marginnote{Protocol stack?} one wish was that it should be able to serve more than just one application at a time. This brings a need for such process-to-process delivery that the transport layer protocols provide. In this chapter, the design and implementation of a transport layer protocol (in this entire chapter referred to as \textit{the protocol}) is described. To the extend possible, the above- and underlying layers are viewed as if they are unknown to the protocol, in order to provide a generic interface.
