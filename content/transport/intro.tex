\chapter{Transport layer}\label{chap:transport}
In the OSI model, the session and transport layers handle process-to-process communication and sessions, respectively. Sessions are chiefly used when synchronous transfer is needed \cite[39]{KOM}. When initially exploring ideas for this networking protocol stack, one wish was that it should be able to serve more than just one application at a time.\marginnote{Ref!} This brings a need for such process-to-process delivery that the transport layer protocols provide. In this chapter, the design and implementation of a transport layer protocol (in this entire chapter referred to as \textit{the protocol}) is described. To the extent possible, the above- and underlying layers are viewed as if they are unknown to the protocol, in order to provide a generic interface to them.
