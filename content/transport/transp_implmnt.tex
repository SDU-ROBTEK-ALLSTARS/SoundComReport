\section{Implementation}\label{sec:trans_implementation}
Armed with the specifications and design decisions discussed in Section \ref{sec:trans_theory} it is time to step into the implementation phase. In practice this process is iterative, and the demands sometimes change with issues that emerge while working. This section aims to explain this process and describe some of the iterative steps that were taken.


\subsection{General structure}
First, in order to gain an overview of how the transport layer protocol is implemented, the general design structure is going to be clarified in the following. When first beginning the process of writing code, two main entities were identified. One is the protocol system itself, and other one is the packet data structure. These two are implemented as the C++ classes \custtt{DtmfTransport} and \custtt{Packet}.

The \custtt{DtmfTransport} class takes care of the connection and most of the features described in the design specifications. It is both the interface to the rest of the system and the connection caretaker. To specify; \custtt{DtmfTransport} is essentially initiating, maintaining and closing connections - although it all happens on command of the user (through the API). The \custtt{DtmfTransport} class makes use of the services provided by the \custtt{Packet} class to be able to set up, and manipulate, packet data structures.

\custtt{Packet} directly represents the packet format as it is specified in Section \ref{sub:trans_packet_format}, meaning it basically consists of 8 bytes of header and up to 120 bytes of data. Add to that, a number of member functions are used to access or manipulate private members. The most important of these methods is probably \custtt{make()}, which is used to delay the initialization of the object members. Thus, packet objects can in fact be passed around while their data fields are empty.


\subsection{Function classification}
To better explain which member functions are doing what, they are split into two classifications: Core- and compatibility functions. The core functions are the ones providing functionality by directly implementing features that are described in the protocol design section. Compatibility functions are functions which are added to make the protocol compatible with other parts of the networking system.

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:trans_function_classification} shows a list of member functions. Note that not all member functions, that are in the source files, are listed. Those not listed are merely specialised versions of other functions, or functions to access private member data (doing nothing else). As such they are not of great interest. The essential functions will be described more thoroughly in the following text, while the compatibility functions will only be touched upon briefly: They are mainly to fetch data out of buffers, to format data in certain ways or to convert between object types. Yet they are important to mention.


\subsection{Main protocol interface}
The layers of the protocol stack are being developed simultaneously. Therefore having well-defined interfaces - even before implementation is undertaken - is essential. Otherwise one might risk incompatibility. To accomplish the goal of creating a good interface, the team collaborated on defining the in- and output of the two methods \custtt{encode()} and \custtt{decode()}. These two methods define the public interface to the \custtt{DtmfTransport} class.

 \caption{The transport layer protocol main interface methods.}
 \label{fig:trans_encode_decode}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trans_encode_decode} shows the \custtt{encode()} and \custtt{decode()} functions, and what in- and output they expect from the above API, and the underlying data link layer.


\subsection{Encoding messages from the API}
To first elaborate on the function of the \custtt{encode()} method, we see that it requires a message in the form of a \custtt{DtmfOutMessage} object, as described in more detail in Section \ref{sec:api_message_types}. This message object from the API contains the receivers port number as well as a pointer to an array of data. This is the data we want to cut into pieces of the right size, to enclose in the \custtt{Packet} object.

The compatibility method \custtt{toPacketFromApi()} serves as a tool to create a suitable number of packets. Only the destination port and data fields are initialized at this point, though. The packet does not yet contain all the header information needed to send it. \custtt{toPacketFromApi()} places addresses of the created packets in the FIFO queue \custtt{outQueue\_}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

 \includegraphics[scale=0.66,trim=0 170 0 170]{content/graphics/transport/trans_encode_flowchart_simple.pdf}%trim=l b r t
 \caption{The transport layer protocol \smalltt{encode()} function (simplified).}
 \label{fig:trans_encode_flowchart_simple}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trans_encode_flowchart_simple} shows a simplified flowchart of the protocol encode function. It is seen how the rest of the header fields are filled by \custtt{DtmfTransport} automatically without user interaction. If the connection status is not read as ''connected'', the first packet to be sent is a SYN packet, where the sequence number is randomly generated - the \custtt{connect()} function takes care of that. If the connection is already established, the data packets queued by \custtt{toPacketFromApi()} will be sent (to the \custtt{TransportDllDown} buffer which the data link layer protocol reads from) with an appropriate sequence- and acknowledgment number.

The core method \custtt{processOutgoingPacket()} manages the handling of outgoing packets after they are converted from the \custtt{DtmfOutMessage} object. More specifically it checks to find out which sequence and acknowledgment number should be attached. It also takes care of setting a time stamp for specific sequence numbers being sent. When a packet is received, a check is made to see if it acknowledges the time-stamped sequence number before too much time has passed. If not, the packet in question, and any unacknowledged in between, are resent.


\subsection{Decoding messages from the data link layer}
The method to pass data from the data link layer to the transport layer protocol, is chosen to simply be an array of bytes. These bytes are stored in a buffer. A pointer to this buffer is then passed on to the transport protocol, so that data can be read. It is the protocol's responsibility to make sense of this array of bytes. This is done via the compatibility \custtt{packetFromCharBuffer()} method, which is a member of \custtt{DtmfTransport}. It examines the buffer to see if there is enough data to make out the header: If that is the case, the packet header will be assembled to find out exactly what kind of response should be triggered.

\begin{figure}[htb]

 \includegraphics[scale=0.66,trim=0 200 0 200]{content/graphics/transport/trans_decode_flowchart_simple.pdf}%trim=l b r t
 \caption{The transport layer protocol \smalltt{decode()} function (simplified).}
 \label{fig:trans_decode_flowchart_simple}
\end{figure}

The simplified \custtt{decode()} method is shown on Figure \ref{fig:trans_decode_flowchart_simple}. The \custtt{process\-Received\-Packet()} method is the ''decision maker'' of the \custtt{decode()} function. It makes sure to generate the appropriate response to a received packet: If an incoming acknowledgment number matches an unacknowledged, sent, packet it is deleted from the unacknowledged queue (see for example Figure \ref{fig:trans_syn_packburst}).


\subsection{Unacknowledged packet queues}
The concept of queues containing the unacknowledged packets is, in fact, realised as a \custtt{map} (standard library) container. This allows mapping of sequence numbers (from either received or sent packets) to \custtt{packet} data structure. That way one can easily find packets of a specific sequence number via. \custtt{find()} (of the algorithm standard library). One other property of the map container is, that entries are automatically sorted by key value. That way one can easily fetch packets in the right order (by sequence number), by iterating from either the beginning or the end of the map.
