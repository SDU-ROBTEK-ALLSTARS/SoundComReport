\chapter{Experiments}\label{chap:experiments}
Throughout the development a lot of testing have been done to debug the program. This chapter is concerned about testing done towards the systems conditions. How much noise can it handle, what is the speed and ... 

This is the result from these tests.


\section{Psychical Layer}

\begin{itemize}
\item physical tests? (throughput, background noise detection, etc)
\item with test clas
\end{itemize}

\section{Data link layer}

\begin{itemize}
\item A test have been beformed were error was introduced to a signal
\item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Transport Layer}

\begin{itemize}
