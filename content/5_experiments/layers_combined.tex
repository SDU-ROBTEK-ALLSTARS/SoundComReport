\section{Layers combined}

These are the tests which were originally planned for the combined application. They were chosen because these are the tests predicted to give the best analysis of the systems performance and reliability. Unfortunately since the combined application is not at the moment fully working, none of these tests were performed.

\begin{description}
\item[Transfer speed] is performed by sending a files of varying size between to computers. The time is recorded an thus can the systems speed be recorded.
\item[Ping test] is performed by sending ping messages between to computers while the program has different payloads. First when there is no data being transferred between them. Secondly the two experiments are conducted with a file transfer alternately from the computers. Lastly a test is performed while both computers send files to each other.
