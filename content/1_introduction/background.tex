This project is devised as a part of the B.Sc. Robot Systems Engineering, 3rd term course at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark, Odense autumn 2011. The implicit goal is to obtain knowledge of computer applications for signal processing. The head focus will be the understanding of analogue and digital signals and integrating this processing in computer applications where computer architecture, operating systems and data communication will appear in the project as significant competences.

Because the DSMI\footnote{The Engineering Education Model of the University of Southern Denmark} model is used as a framework for this particular education, it is required for the students participating in this course to formulate a strategy for solving an assignment in teams.
