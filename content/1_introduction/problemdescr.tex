\section{Requirements}
This project has in many ways an experimental approach, where it is largely up to the students to figure out how to solve this assignment. This is due to the requirement of building a protocol stack which uses DTMF tones as data carriers. The exact requirements of the assignment are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Computers have to communicate by exchanging sound.
\item DTMF tones have to be used and a protocol stack have to be build.
\item Information have to be exchanged between computers.
\item A distributed application have to be developed in C++.
\item The architecture have to be layered.
\item It is required that the application perform some meaningful task.
\end{itemize}
