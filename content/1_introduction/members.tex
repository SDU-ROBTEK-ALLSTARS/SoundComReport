\section{Project members}
This section will serve as an introduction to each of the project group members. It briefly tells which parts of the project, each member has concerned himself with mostly and what role he has been filling. These roles originate from the Belbin team role model. As the project was begun, the group sat down and discussed which roles they would like to try and fill. They were selected out of a wish to learn what a particular role would involve, and not necessarily what each member is best at.
